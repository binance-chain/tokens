2. Upload your logo in your folder

- [ ] Filename in the `uppercase` format with suffix
- [ ] Image format: `png`
- [ ] Image size: `256 by 256 px`

3. Upload a json file for additional info. File name is your token symbol in the `uppercase` format with suffix

* `asset` must be your token's symbol
* `asserMap` must be your token's symbol without suffix
* `display`'s default value is `true`, which means the information will be available in the explorer
